## Overview

This project showcases popular classical ciphers implemented in Java to simulate basic secure communication strategies. The code is beginner-friendly and ideal for students or anyone interested in the fundamentals of cryptography.

## Implemented Techniques

The following encryption-decryption techniques are implemented:

1. **Caesar Cipher**
2. **Monoalphabetic Cipher**
3. **Playfair Cipher**
4. **Rail Fence Cipher**
5. **Vigen√®re Cipher**

Each class contains logic for:
- Encrypting a given plaintext
- Decrypting the ciphertext using the appropriate key or method

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or a text editor and terminal

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joydeep1007/encryption-decryption_cybersecurity-techniques.git
   cd encryption-decryption_cybersecurity-techniques
